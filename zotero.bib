	abstract = {In this essay, I explore several facets of research through design in order to contribute to discussions about how the approach should develop. The essay has three parts. In the first, I review two influential theories from the Philosophy of Science to help reflect on the nature of design theory, concluding that research through design is likely to produce theories that are provisional, contingent, and aspirational. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and - especially - its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts.},

	title = {The logic of annotated portfolios: communicating the value of 'research through design'},
	abstract = {This paper examines Research Through Design as an orientation to so-called ‘Third Wave’ Human Computer Interaction (HCI). A number of recent critical reflections are reviewed and the ‘disciplinary anxieties’, which this approach to HCI has aroused, are discussed. Drawing on Feyerabend’s philosophical scepticism over methods and contributions to the Sociology of Science, it is suggested that design research might build its own ‘limited rationality’ rather than be brought in line with supposed norms for good research or criteria for rigour and relevance of unfamiliar provenance. To this end, a concept of ‘annotated portfolio’ is advanced, and detailed, as a means for capturing the family resemblances that exist in a collection of artefacts, simultaneously respecting the particularity of specific designs and engaging with broader concerns. The concept is demonstrated through annotating nine well-known pieces created by the Goldsmiths Interaction Research Studio. Treating this collection as an annotated portfolio highlights, formulates and collates interaction design issues in this work in a novel manner. On this basis, annotated portfolios are proposed as a viable means for communicating design thinking in HCI in a descriptive yet generative and inspirational fashion, without having recourse to standards of ‘theory’ which fit design practice uncomfortably.},

As such, it is one of the elements in the Becoming Vincent project. The chapter highlights the complexity of the heritage ecosystem underlying the project, consisting of various stakeholders with diverse, sometimes diverging or even incompatible, interests and goals. In this chapter, we discuss how we coped with this diversity and we draw some of the lessons we learnt from this process for future use. The most important lesson is the need to involve all stakeholders from the start of the process and to treat them equally, despite visible differences in their relative interest in the outcome of the project, in order to give them the feeling to have ownership on the expected outcome, and therefore to enhance the chances that they will support it after the project completion. At the same time, it is important to keep the network structure simple and clear in order to avoid unnecessary or redundant passages in the knowledge transmission within this web of relations. While not specific for museums but prone to be applied to any complex networked situation, this approach has helped us cope with a complex cultural ecosystem.},

While significant attention has concentrated on the mass media, less consideration has been given to examining the role of museums and science centres in communicating the science of climate change.

While design has gained a strong foothold in practice, it has had much less impact on the HCI research community. In this paper we propose a new model for interaction design research within HCI. Following a research through design approach, designers produce novel integrations of HCI research in an attempt to make the right thing: a product that transforms the world from its current state to a preferred state. This model allows interaction designers to make research contributions based on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems. To formalize this model, we provide a set of four lenses for evaluating the research contribution and a set of three examples to illustrate the benefits of this type of research.},

	abstract = {The museum world has undergone radical change since the 1970s. Political and economic pressures have forced its professionals to shift their attention from their collections towards visitors. Whereas in the past the museum tended to be exclusive and elitist, signs of a progressive opening-up and greater accessibility have appeared. A climate of increasing reflexivity within the profession is identified as a ‘new museology’. The paper draws on data derived from semi-structured interviews with curators and directors from five local museums. I argue that the movement towards a more visitor-centred ethos can be seen as entailing a corresponding shift in the identity of the museum professional, from ‘legislator’ to ‘interpreter’ of cultural meaning. The argument, adapted from Zygmunt Bauman, is that intellectuals are being redefined in a shift from legislator to interpreter. Finally, I argue that this process of transition, as it occurs in museums, is by no means complete. Drawing on Basil Bernstein’s seminal work in educational sociology I propose that museums are also resistant to these forces of change.},

	abstract = {This paper offers theoretical support for research through design (RtD) by arguing that to legitimize and make use of research through design as research, HCI researchers need to explore and clarify how RtD objects contribute to knowledge. One way to pursue this goal is to leverage knowledge-producing tactics of the arts and humanities traditions of aesthetics, key among which is a communitywide and ongoing critical analysis of aesthetic objects. Along these lines, we argue that while the intentions of the object’s designer are important and annotations are a good mechanism to articulate them, the critical reception of objects can be equally generative of RtD’s knowledge impacts. Such a scholarly critical reception is needed because of the potential inexhaustibility of design objects’ meanings, their inability to be paraphrased adequately. Offering a multilevel analysis of the (critical) design fiction Menstruation Machine by Sputniko!, the paper explores how design objects co-produce knowledge, by working through complex design problem spaces in non-reductive ways, proposing new connections and distinctions, and embodying design ideas and processes across time and minds.},

We analyzed visitors’ engagement with the Yumi’s Cell Special Exhibition (hereafter Yumi) held in South Korea, employing computer vision for the analysis of visitors’ Instagram pictures. Our research questions are: What types of pictures do visitors post on Instagram during or after their visit? And can Yumi’s instagrammable features make visitors interact more with the exhibition? We also formulated two corresponding hypotheses: Visitors are primarily interested in taking selﬁes in the instagrammable environment; and visitors struck more active poses when taking pictures in an instagrammable exhibition than in a traditional art exhibition. Through the image analysis of Instagram posts of the exhibition, we found many pictures of people, but the proportion of selﬁes was relatively limited. This suggests that visitors were more interested in interacting with the exhibition rather than taking selﬁes. This has also been conﬁrmed by the pose analysis, which showed that the participatory feature of the exhibition encouraged visitors to take photos in active poses, interacting, mimicking, and performing. The framework presented and the ﬁndings oﬀer insights about how to design exhibitions to increase visitors’ participation.},

An observation of multiple facets of attitude revealed that the intention to act against climate change did not increase significantly even though other facets of attitude like emotional involvement and knowledge did. Interestingly, those students that both visited the exhibition and had a follow-up class showed a decreased intent to act against climate change compared to the group that only experienced the exhibition. Those students whose action intent increased significantly were likely to be personally interested in Earth Sciences, prefer an abstract/linguistic learning style and feel that their actions would be acknowledged by peers.},

There have also been efforts to provide new ways of thinking about the activity of using prototypes, such as experience prototyping and paper prototyping, but these efforts do not provide a discourse for understanding fundamental characteristics of prototypes. In this article, we propose an anatomy of prototypes as a framework for prototype conceptualization. We view prototypes not only in their role in evaluation but also in their generative role in enabling designers to reflect on their design activities in exploring a design space. We base this framework on the findings of two case studies that reveal two key dimensions: prototypes as filters and prototypes as manifestations. We explain why these two dimensions are important and how this conceptual framework can benefit our field by establishing more solid and systematic knowledge about prototypes and prototyping.},

The article begins with Mezirow's explanation of the stages of transformative learning, continues with the influences on the theory, transitions into the criticisms, and concludes with a discussion of its evolution and development.},
