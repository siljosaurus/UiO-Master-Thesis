Our research was initiated by the question why something like PL can create such enthusiasm and interest over the years, while at the same time not be more widespread and successful? In this paper, we examine the experiences and expectations that HCI researchers who have been involved in PL research have had and still have when it comes to PL. Based on the literature review and interview studies, we provide some overall reflections and several possible directions on the use of PL in HCI.},

	abstract = {Based on case studies from a heritage/museum context, I present and illustrate the notion of “spatio-contextual embedding,” which conceptualizes installation designs that augment real objects and environments while keeping these primary focuses of attention. Key for this “embeddedness” is that interaction is contextualized within a meaningful setting, creating relationships between system and environment. While retaining a focus on original objects or environments, it supports user's active engagement and sense making by inviting, enticing, or forcing them to draw connections. At the heart of this is “indexing”: mindful acts of referencing back-and-forth between here and there, connecting objects or representations. Analysis of case studies provides a repertoire of examples of “indexing,” and examples for high- and low-tech installation designs that foster drawing of connections. Two core values for design underpin the argument: (1) primacy of real objects and environments and (2) supporting human agency. The case examples highlight how technological arrangements may support or hinder indexing activity. This is condensed into potential design strategies. This article contributes to design knowledge on design for human agency, sense making, and mindful engagement with our environment. “Indexing” is relevant beyond the heritage setting domain, as part of HCI design in support of human agency.},

It provides a rich and as yet untapped source of inspiration for driving the practice of experience design. However, there are currently no guidelines that describe how to apply this theory in design practice. Taking a research through design approach, I made many different products with the goal of helping people become the person they desire to be through their product interactions. Then, in order to better understand how the different design teams applied attachment theory, I created a set of design patterns that document the application of product attachment theory to the interaction design of each product. I clustered the patterns based on similarities across the different artifacts, and this produced six framing constructs, which work as specific perspectives designers can take when applying product attachment theory in an experience design project.},

	abstract = {In this paper we report on an exploration of how to apply the theory of Slow Design to mass produced products to establish more mindful usage of products; the intention behind this is to promote product attachment and the associated sustainable benefits of long term use. Slow Design is a design philosophy that focuses on promoting well-being for individuals, society, and the natural environment. It encourages people to do things at the right time and at the right speed which helps them to understand and reflect on their actions. Several authors have proposed Slow Design principles and cases have been reported in which these principles were applied in cultural design projects. These applications indicated that Slow Design can indeed have a positive impact on wellbeing. Although promising, this philosophy has not yet been used in the design of mass consumer products. In this paper we present a design case study in which we explored how the Slow Design principles can be applied in the design of an electric fruit juicer. Two studies are reported on where the conditions for implementing Slow Design are explored. The results led to a revision of the principles for use by product designers. The main finding from the case study is that the Slow Design principles can be used to create more ‘mindful’ interactions that stimulate positive user involvement. This is not from designing interactions that require more time per se, but by stimulating the user to use more time for those parts of the interaction that are meaningful and less for those that are not meaningful.},

Arguably, insights from existential philosophy and psychology are highly relevant for addressing such issues. Building on previous attempts to bring in existential themes and terminology to HCI, this paper argues that Yalom’s notion of “the givens of existence”, as well as related work in experimental existential psychology, can inform the development of an existential inquiry framework in HCI. The envisioned framework is intended to complement current approaches in HCI by specifically focusing on the existential aspects of the design and use of technology. The paper reflects on possible ways, in which existential concepts can support HCI research, and maintains that adopting an existential framework in HCI would be consistent with the overall conceptual development of the field.},

In the first, I review two influential theories from the Philosophy of Science to help reflect on the nature of design theory, concluding that research through design is likely to produce theories that are provisional, contingent, and aspirational. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and - especially - its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts.},

	title = {The logic of annotated portfolios: communicating the value of 'research through design'},
	abstract = {This paper examines Research Through Design as an orientation to so-called ‘Third Wave’ Human Computer Interaction (HCI). A number of recent critical reflections are reviewed and the ‘disciplinary anxieties’, which this approach to HCI has aroused, are discussed. Drawing on Feyerabend’s philosophical scepticism over methods and contributions to the Sociology of Science, it is suggested that design research might build its own ‘limited rationality’ rather than be brought in line with supposed norms for good research or criteria for rigour and relevance of unfamiliar provenance. To this end, a concept of ‘annotated portfolio’ is advanced, and detailed, as a means for capturing the family resemblances that exist in a collection of artefacts, simultaneously respecting the particularity of specific designs and engaging with broader concerns. The concept is demonstrated through annotating nine well-known pieces created by the Goldsmiths Interaction Research Studio. Treating this collection as an annotated portfolio highlights, formulates and collates interaction design issues in this work in a novel manner. On this basis, annotated portfolios are proposed as a viable means for communicating design thinking in HCI in a descriptive yet generative and inspirational fashion, without having recourse to standards of ‘theory’ which fit design practice uncomfortably.},

The chapter highlights the complexity of the heritage ecosystem underlying the project, consisting of various stakeholders with diverse, sometimes diverging or even incompatible, interests and goals. In this chapter, we discuss how we coped with this diversity and we draw some of the lessons we learnt from this process for future use. The most important lesson is the need to involve all stakeholders from the start of the process and to treat them equally, despite visible differences in their relative interest in the outcome of the project, in order to give them the feeling to have ownership on the expected outcome, and therefore to enhance the chances that they will support it after the project completion. At the same time, it is important to keep the network structure simple and clear in order to avoid unnecessary or redundant passages in the knowledge transmission within this web of relations. While not specific for museums but prone to be applied to any complex networked situation, this approach has helped us cope with a complex cultural ecosystem.},

This model allows interaction designers to make research contributions based on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems.

Political and economic pressures have forced its professionals to shift their attention from their collections towards visitors. Whereas in the past the museum tended to be exclusive and elitist, signs of a progressive opening-up and greater accessibility have appeared. A climate of increasing reflexivity within the profession is identified as a ‘new museology’. The paper draws on data derived from semi-structured interviews with curators and directors from five local museums. I argue that the movement towards a more visitor-centred ethos can be seen as entailing a corresponding shift in the identity of the museum professional, from ‘legislator’ to ‘interpreter’ of cultural meaning. The argument, adapted from Zygmunt Bauman, is that intellectuals are being redefined in a shift from legislator to interpreter. Finally, I argue that this process of transition, as it occurs in museums, is by no means complete. Drawing on Basil Bernstein’s seminal work in educational sociology I propose that museums are also resistant to these forces of change.},

	abstract = {This paper offers theoretical support for research through design (RtD) by arguing that to legitimize and make use of research through design as research, HCI researchers need to explore and clarify how RtD objects contribute to knowledge. One way to pursue this goal is to leverage knowledge-producing tactics of the arts and humanities traditions of aesthetics, key among which is a communitywide and ongoing critical analysis of aesthetic objects. Along these lines, we argue that while the intentions of the object’s designer are important and annotations are a good mechanism to articulate them, the critical reception of objects can be equally generative of RtD’s knowledge impacts. Such a scholarly critical reception is needed because of the potential inexhaustibility of design objects’ meanings, their inability to be paraphrased adequately. Offering a multilevel analysis of the (critical) design fiction Menstruation Machine by Sputniko!, the paper explores how design objects co-produce knowledge, by working through complex design problem spaces in non-reductive ways, proposing new connections and distinctions, and embodying design ideas and processes across time and minds.},

	abstract = {This study aims to show how a museum exhibition designed to encourage visitors to take pictures can aﬀect visitors’ behavior. We analyzed visitors’ engagement with the Yumi’s Cell Special Exhibition (hereafter Yumi) held in South Korea, employing computer vision for the analysis of visitors’ Instagram pictures. Our research questions are: What types of pictures do visitors post on Instagram during or after their visit? And can Yumi’s instagrammable features make visitors interact more with the exhibition? We also formulated two corresponding hypotheses: Visitors are primarily interested in taking selﬁes in the instagrammable environment; and visitors struck more active poses when taking pictures in an instagrammable exhibition than in a traditional art exhibition. Through the image analysis of Instagram posts of the exhibition, we found many pictures of people, but the proportion of selﬁes was relatively limited. This suggests that visitors were more interested in interacting with the exhibition rather than taking selﬁes. This has also been conﬁrmed by the pose analysis, which showed that the participatory feature of the exhibition encouraged visitors to take photos in active poses, interacting, mimicking, and performing. The framework presented and the ﬁndings oﬀer insights about how to design exhibitions to increase visitors’ participation.},

However, significant changes in the environment in which museums operate have led to the creation of new types of activities to attract different audiences who will contribute to their future economic and social sustainability. One group that has recently been identified as a target is Generation Y (Gen Y) who have been attracted through the specifically created night-time thematic events, or ‘Lates’. This study critically evaluates visitor engagement with both permanent collections and activities specifically developed for the Gen Y visitor at a ‘Lates’ event at a national museum. The paper explores the potential contribution of this type of event in enhancing the future sustainability of museums via balanced use of resources, visitor engagement across a diverse audience and contribution to the achievement of long term goals.},

The case study presented here investigated how KLIMA X contributed to a change in young people’s attitudes towards climate change. A mixed method was applied by combining a scientific field experiment and Personal Meaning Mapping. An observation of multiple facets of attitude revealed that the intention to act against climate change did not increase significantly even though other facets of attitude like emotional involvement and knowledge did. Interestingly, those students that both visited the exhibition and had a follow-up class showed a decreased intent to act against climate change compared to the group that only experienced the exhibition. Those students whose action intent increased significantly were likely to be personally interested in Earth Sciences, prefer an abstract/linguistic learning style and feel that their actions would be acknowledged by peers.},

	abstract = {The role of prototypes is well established in the field of HCI and Design. A lack of knowledge, however, about the fundamental nature of prototypes still exists. Researchers have attempted to identify different types of prototypes, such as low- vs. high-fidelity prototypes, but these attempts have centered on evaluation rather than support of design exploration. There have also been efforts to provide new ways of thinking about the activity of using prototypes, such as experience prototyping and paper prototyping, but these efforts do not provide a discourse for understanding fundamental characteristics of prototypes. In this article, we propose an anatomy of prototypes as a framework for prototype conceptualization. We view prototypes not only in their role in evaluation but also in their generative role in enabling designers to reflect on their design activities in exploring a design space. We base this framework on the findings of two case studies that reveal two key dimensions: prototypes as filters and prototypes as manifestations. We explain why these two dimensions are important and how this conceptual framework can benefit our field by establishing more solid and systematic knowledge about prototypes and prototyping.},
