This thesis reports from an analysis of 21 interactive installations, seeking to answer how one can design meaningful interactive experiences in a museum space that addresses sustainability. Throughout the thesis we present the creation of a theoretical framework to identify and generate data that makes visible dialogic behaviour, suitable for analysing the exhibition and judge how the installations stimulate dialogue, conversations or reflections. This is how the thesis frames and capture meaningfulness in exhibition design. We then present a list of patterns that have objectified meaningfulness through a description of dialogical behaviour between the visitor and the interactive installation. The main findings in this thesis is the theoretical framework, and the list of patterns derived from using the framework.
