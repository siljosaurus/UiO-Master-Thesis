The thesis investigates how interactivity can support visitors meaning-making in a museum space. The hypothesis is that an interactive installation or experience have the potential to reinforce the message conveyed in a manner that give rise to thought-provoking or significant reflections that last long after the museum visit. Something which also encompass the power to deliberately stimulate visitors lifestyle choices or actions after the museum visit, in compliance with the museums agenda and vision. Special attention has been given to museums that aims to encourage social action, like climate consciousness or climate action.

I present a “framework” that consist of a vocabulary to look at how one can design interactive meaningful experiences in a museum space.
