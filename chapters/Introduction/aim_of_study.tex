\section{Museum's role in society}

In the recommendation letter report \emph{“Museums in the society - trust, things and time,”} the standing committee of Cultural Affairs presents the overall political direction for Norwegian museum policy towards the year 2050 (Figure 1.1). The report establishes that Norwegian museum institutions take aim to express both historical and current developments in society. And that museum institutions play an important role in our own time’s understanding of ourselves - both who we have been, who we are, and whom we want to be \autocite[p. 7]{melding23}. Modern museum operations aim to actively turn to the general public with the objective to build and share knowledge, increase enlightenment and cultivate cultural capital. Where the early museum institutions, first and foremost, were accessible to a small number of privileged class members, it is now expected that museums purposefully reach out to be open and accessible to all residents and age groups \autocite[p. 14]{melding23}. In Norway, museums are increasingly understood as both knowledge and social institutions, where dissemination and exhibition practice are curated accordingly. At the same time, museums have emerged as an alternative learning arena for school children, first regarding history teaching, but later in many other subject areas as well. In a society where polarization and public debate are intensifying, arenas that have the public's confidence in being able to nuance and disseminate different perspectives are needed \autocite[p. 7]{melding23}.

There is a saying among historians that \emph{"the past teaches us about the present"}. History is a subject that is extra rich in perspectives, explanations, and ideas about how people have lived, thought, and acted. It positions us to see patterns that might otherwise be invisible in the present – thus providing a crucial perspective for understanding and solving current and future problems \autocite{UW_website}. Being a knowledge institution, museums have the power to both define and showcase relevant historical events as a perspective to inform present societal issues and debates.

% Skiftet til museene handler ikke bare om å fornye seg, altså appellere til en bredere målgruppe, men det handler om å "henge med i tiden", og klare å forankre dagsaktuelle debatter/ samtaler med et faglig, vitenskapelig korrekt, blikk.

\section{Motivation}
Short orientation on motivation for topic. Say something about \emph{why} meaningfulness.


\section{Research question and framing of project}
The aim of this study is to gain insight to try answer how one can design interactive meaningful experiences in a museum space that addresses sustainability. To understand this, several installations have been analysed as a way to objectify \emph{meaningfulness} as a quality that you can design for. In the HCI community, meaningfulness is recognised as a quality in made products or artefacts that not only make people more efficient and effective, but through use in activities, relationships, routines, and rituals, become meaningful \autocite{zimmerman_designing_2009}. This thesis fills a gap in the literature where the term is explored through a museum context for experience designers, trying to objectify meaningfulness as an interactive quality that support dialogic behaviour between visitors and installations in museums. Special attention has been given to museums that aim to encourage social action, like climate consciousness or climate action as examples of meaningful behaviour museums addressing contemporary discourses want to encourage.

This thesis aim to answer how one can design meaningful interactive experiences in a museum space that addresses sustainability. This is attempted through objectifying meaningfulness as a quality that you can design for in a museum, by identifying and analysing dialogic relations between visitor and installation.

In my attempt to answer how one can design meaningful interactive experiences in a museum space that addresses sustainability, I have composed concepts from three theoretical approaches to place-centred design to make my own theoretical framework to better understand interactive artefacts dialogic qualities and museum experience design. This attempts to answer how museum spaces can look at their respective installations and judge whether or not they stimulate the visitor to dialogue. The hypothesis is that there lies value for the museum to judge whether or not their installations promote dialogue.

\section{Scientific contribution}
The thesis investigates how interactivity can support visitors meaning-making in a museum space. The hypothesis is that an interactive installation or experience have the potential to reinforce the message conveyed in a manner that give rise to thought-provoking or significant reflections that last long after the museum visit. Something which also encompass the power to deliberately stimulate visitors lifestyle choices or actions after the museum visit, in compliance with the museums agenda and vision.

\section{Chapter overview}
The thesis is divided into three parts; Introduction, Design Process, and Review/ Evaluation. The (report) structure reflects the methodological nature of doing Research through Design, where the Design Process is evidence of the practical activities shaping the thesis project. If not referenced otherwise, all pictures in this thesis come from a shared photo library the research buddies and I have built up and accumulated during fieldwork. The same goes for illustrations. If not referenced else-wise, they are illustrated by me.

\subsubsection{Chapter 2: Modern museums and sustainability}
Chapter 2 is a focused selection of terminology and concepts attained from the literature review that has been conducted throughout/during the thesis project. It is structured in the hope that designers interested in the topic can adopt the concepts as a vocabulary and mean of understanding some of what goes on in the museum world. The literature review has nonetheless been crucial for the thesis evolution. On the one hand, it has influenced the research framing and interest, shaped and refined the research question, and leveraged the vocabulary when documenting/ recounting an exhibition- and installation experience. While on the other hand, it has influenced the convergent and divergent thought process when going in and out/back-and-forth of practical and theoretical work, the designer role, and the researcher role.

\subsubsection{Chapter 3: Three approaches to place-centred design }
Chapter 3 is a continuation of the literature review. Where Chapter 2 indirectly affect the thesis evolution, Chapter 3 present three theoretical approaches that have formatively guided e.g. data-gathering guides during fieldwork, both for observations, interviews and analytical critique.

\subsubsection{Chapter 4: A new way of designing for meaningfulness?}
In Chapter 4, we build upon and borrow concepts from the three theoretical approaches presented in Chapter 3, in the making of a new theoretical framework as a proposal of a new way of designing for meaningfulness.
