Thanks, thank you, thanks, thanks, thanks, thank you thank you, wow such support, thanks, thanks, thanks I feel so supported, thanks thanks, thank you, thank you

% First of all I want to express my thanks and gratitude for my superhero-supervisor Joshi. Thank you for your patience, new perspectives and good talks throughout the thesis project. Your guidance, affirmations, and critical eye have been crucial for the coming-together of the project and report!

% Dear Janni and Sandra, thank you for the collaboration efforts throughout the thesis project! It has been a joy visiting museums and doing fieldwork with you. Talking, reflecting and discussing with you have shaped and driven forward the scope and interest of this thesis in so many ways. I am so proud of the work we have done together, and how the three thesis's complement each other. 

% Thank you Adrian for dragging me out of the university and making me disconnect from the pc and thesis from time-to-time, or else I would have turned proper mad scientist. Thanks for geeking out on the Timeless Way of Building and on The Phenomenon of Life with me. These conversations have not only fulfilled a lot of the missing pieces in the thesis, I see us growing so much as designers simultaneously. Now lets go surfing!!

% And of course, thank you to all of my ifi-friends. Studying during a pandemic and war in Europe has not been easy on any of us, but we have done the best we could nonetheless. Special thanks to my peeps from the coffee-break gang, and the design-folks on the 7th floor for making the last two years such a good time. I have looked forward to seeing you every day. Thank you for all the fun nights out, the weekly climbing sessions, the long lunch breaks and for being supportive in all the right ways when things have been difficult.

% Thank you to my friends and family for checking in on me, sending heartfelt words and thoughts my way.

% This thesis has forever changed museum-going for me. I have found it immensely fun to deep-dive into the museum domain, which I did not have much knowledge on beforehand. I am glad to have derived new skills and perspectives that I will take with me in future designer practise. Hope that those of you who find the thesis interesting do the same. Ok hehe bye, enjoy the reading! -Silje
