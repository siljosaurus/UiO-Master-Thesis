% First of all I want to express my thanks and gratitude for superhero-supervisor Joshi for your continual support, encouragement and good talks throughout the thesis project. Thank you for presenting the thesis, museums will never be the same again :p

% Dear Janni and Sandra, thank you for the collaboration efforts throughout the thesis project! It has been a joy visiting museums and doing fieldwork with you. Talking, reflecting and discussing with you have shaped and driven forward the scope and interest of this thesis in so many ways, and I am so proud of the work we have done together, and how the three thesis's complement each other. 

% Thank you Adrian for dragging me out of the university and making me disconnect from the pc and thesis, or else I think I would have gone crazy. Now lets go surfing!!

% And of course, thank you to all of my ifi-friends. Studying during a pandemic and war in Europe has not been easy on any of us, but we have done the best we could nonetheless. Special thanks to my peeps from the coffee-break gang, and everyone on the 7th floor for making the last two years such a good time. I have looked forward to seeing you every day. Thank you for all the fun, the long lunch breaks and for being supportive in all the right ways when things have been difficult. I will forever look back at this time of my life and smile.

% Thank you to my friends and family for checking in on me, sending heartfelt words and thoughts my way.

% Hope you'll enjoy the reading! :p
