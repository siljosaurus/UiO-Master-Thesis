In this chapter we will go into the structural nature and coming-together of this thesis project. The thesis follows an approach to research practise called Research through Design (RtD). Starting with a listing and outline of all activities that have been done, followed by documentation of the design moves and rationale for these moves throughout the project.


\section{Joint forces with two research buddies}
This thesis is based on quite extensive amounts of fieldwork and design activities that has been made possible because of a joint effort with two other master-students; Janni Rasmussen and Anh Thy Sandra Nguyen. In this thesis they are referred to as my research buddies. We all chose the same thesis outline, but writes separately and have developed our own research agendas. In the early stages we worked together in terms of getting to know the domain and context, for the most part discussing and sharing literature insights. Already during the spring 2021 we started to single out different areas of interests. Regardless of that we have conducted almost all fieldwork together, yet with separate datagathering guides.

Janni is writing about engaging experiences with interactive installations in museums and exhibit spaces, and how engagement can be facilitated with Tangible Interaction. In Sandra's study, she looks into how visitor engagement can be increased through narrative exhibitions, and proposes principles for creating engaging interactive installations in exhibition spaces.


\section{Collaborating with Klimahuset}
The original thesis outline; \emph{interactive and visual installations addressing sustainability} stated Klimahuset as a potential collaboration partner. Klimahuset is a part of University of Oslo: the Natural History Museum. The museum is located in the Botanical Garden at Tøyen, Oslo. Klimahuset represents the type of space where discourses on sustainability matters can take place, available to citizens as a museum. It is newly opened, particularly aimed at young adults aged 14-16. It will be the main space where me and my research buddies will conduct research activities and investigate sustainability issues such as Earth’s climate systems, consequences of global warming, solutions, and what actions individuals can do to contribute to a sustainable transition and future. An important note to the collaboration is that even though some research activities is conducted at Klimahuset, and the end-exhibition will take place there, the end-installation is not supposed to be an artefact designed for Klimahuset. Klimahuset simply provides the contextual space for learning and discussing sustainability-related topics.

\section{Paradigm}
Critical paradigm or "epistemology" 

My general approach was qualitative in which I conducted (this, this and this). The aim was to generate qualitative data on (this, this and this).

\section{Timeline of events}
In this section I will account for the project timeline, presenting all of the events that make up the project. Me and my research buddies have conducted all of the fieldwork together. Details on each event will be provided in chapter 8: Process diary.

The thesis project has been conducted over the course of three semesters. From January- to June spring 2021 I did both theoretical and practical work. In January we met our contact from Klimahuset and had our first viewing and walk-through of the museum's exhibition. Some weeks later we were asked to host a workshop of our choosing that would take place in April. In February I started a literature review focused on getting to know the museum domain, and did so by reading critical literature on exhibition practice \autocite{Thi_book}, on narrative theories and learning in contemporary art museums \autocite{narrative_sitzia}, and on the subject of cultural analysis in museums \autocite{Miekebal_book}, as is evident in chapter 2: The modern museum and Sustainability. To explore the sustainability aspects of the current RQ (\emph{Interactive and visual installations addressing sustainability}), I worked conceptually and explored the topic; a distanced relationship to nature. This later manifested itself in the low-fidelity prototype that was presented at Klimahuset in June 2021. 

All this work contributed to narrow down the research area of interest and in formulating a new research question. 


Next semester, August to December fall 2021, is where most of the practical research efforts were conducted. In September, both me and my research buddies participated in a course about tangible interaction. Through this course we were a part of a team who conceptualised, designed and exhibited an interactive installation during the course duration of one month. Then comes November, where me and my research buddies decided to go to different museums who exhibited interactive installations to experience, observe and collect data on different installations. Late December 2021, my tangible interaction group were requested to exhibit our installation for a group of first-year master students interested in writing about energy-visualisation. And then comes Spring 2022, where the main focus is writing up the thesis. In February we were given the opportunity to observe two school-classes in Klimahsuet, and given a little time to interview with the working Docent's - which we accepted. In March, our supervisor reached out to the Munch museum and giving us the opportunity to interview a concept developer, which we also accepted.

\section{The role of prototyping in this thesis (unfinished)}

Research through design is a type of research practise where the researcher create artefact- or object prototypes to gain the necessary insight needed to drive and conduct the research project. Prototyping, or the use of prototypes can be used in a variety of ways, and in every stage throughout the project. In the field of human-computer interaction (HCI), software engineering and design, the term prototype is commonly used to signify a specific kind of object used in the design process \autocite[p. 2]{lim_anatomy_2008}. The prototypes are either physical or digital, and function as either a speculative solution, as a manifestation of a design idea, or to explore a design space - all in relation to the research scope and focus. Prototypes are the means by which designers organically and evolutionary learn, discover, generate and refine designs \autocite[p. 2]{lim_anatomy_2008}. They are design-thinking enablers deeply embedded and immersed in design practise, not just as tools for evaluating or proving successes or failures of design outcomes \autocite[p. 2]{lim_anatomy_2008}


In the search for a new way of thinking about prototypes and prototyping, based on the need for exploring and establishing a definition that differs from current approaches in software engineering contexts where engineers use prototypes to identify or satisfy requirements: Lim et. al., conceptualise prototypes as tools for traversing a design space where all possible design alternatives and their rationales can be explored \autocite[p. 2]{lim_anatomy_2008}. In that way, the prototype serves as a communicative manifestation, where the designer is enabled to communicate the rationales of their design decisions through the prototype \autocite[p. 2]{lim_anatomy_2008}. Prototypes stimulate reflections, and designers use them to frame, refine and discover possibilities in a design space \autocite[p. 2]{lim_anatomy_2008}. This new way of thinking about prototypes differs markedly from requirement-oriented approaches like software engineering, recognising design activities as flexible rather than rigid, reflective rather than prescriptive, and problem-setting rather than problem-solving (Schön, 1982). A design idea that satisfies all the identified requirements does not guarantee that it is the best design since a number of ways can meet each requirement \autocite[p. 2]{lim_anatomy_2008}. If the focus of prototyping is framing and exploring a design space, what matters is not identifying or satisfying requirements using prototypes but finding the manifestation that in its simplest form, filters the qualities in which designers are interested, without distorting the understanding of the whole \autocite[p. 2]{lim_anatomy_2008}. In order to support this perspective and to provide a stable foundation for the study of prototypes in HCI, Lim et. al. (2008) proposes a framework for conceptualising prototypes. The framework is an attempt to create an understanding of the nature of prototypes in general and to provide a language for articulating the characteristics of a particular prototype \autocite[p. 3]{lim_anatomy_2008}. Two fundamental aspects of prototyping form the basis of the framework:

1) prototypes are for traversing a design space, leading to the creation of meaningful knowledge about the final design as envisioned in the process of design, and
2) prototypes are purposefully formed manifestations of design ideas.
\autocite[p. 3]{lim_anatomy_2008}

Will answer these:
What values are important in my context?
What is my design outcomes?
What is my design space?
Experience prototyping? Am I going to prototype an experience?
Why and how do I intend a particular prototype to support the design process?
