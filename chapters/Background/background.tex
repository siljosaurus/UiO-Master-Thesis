This chapter gives an introduction to literature from the museum field, starting with the ongoing transitional shift to a \emph{new} museology. The chapter will then introduce concepts and terms from exhibition and dissemination practise to extend the vocabulary for talking about museum subjects and roles. Then we will progress into sustainability as a topic representative of a contemporary discourse being addressed in a museum. The chapter is then rounded off with literature on the application and use of technology and interactive installations in "modern museums."

\section{The new museology}
In 1989, Peter Vergo coined the term \emph{the new museology} in a book bearing the same name. Museology is the study of museums, their history and underlying philosophy, and the various ways in which they have during the passing of time, been established and developed \autocite[p.1]{vergo_museology_1989}. Vergo argues that beyond the physical material like handouts or information panels, there is a subtext comprising diverse and often contradictory strands woven from the intellectual, political, or educational preconceptions of the museum stakeholders, e.g. the museum director, the curator, the scholar or the designer \autocite[p.3]{vergo_museology_1989}. Rather than old considerations like administrative tasks, conservation techniques, financial well-being, or, success or neglect in the eyes of the public, the subject matter that should be more questioned or discussed should be more concerned with the museums \emph{purpose} rather than museum \emph{methods} \autocite[p.3]{vergo_museology_1989}. Vergo would therefore define the \emph{new} museology simply as a state of widespread dissatisfaction with the \emph{old} museology considerations. "Unless a radical re-examination of the role of museums within society takes place", Vergo declares that museums in this country (referring to the UK), and possibly elsewhere, may likewise find themselves dubbed 'living fossils' \autocite[p.4]{vergo_museology_1989}.

As Vergo would have it, \emph{"the museum world has undergone radical change since the 1970s. Political and economic pressures have forced its professionals to shift their attention from their collections toward visitors. Whereas in the past, the museum tended to be exclusive and elitist, signs of a progressive opening-up and greater accessibility have appeared. A climate of increasing reflexivity within the profession is identified as a 'new museology'."} \autocite[p. 84]{ross_interpreting_2015}.

\par
%Jobbe litt med overgangen!: much literature have been written on the transition from old to new museology, such as (x, x, x). And then 'new' museology as part of the modernization of museums.
"One of the key terms today is learning in formal and informal contexts. Museums, too, are redefining their mission; instead of focusing on collecting and classifying, the emphasis is now on exhibition design and the museum as a place for communication and learning. The museum has thus become, perhaps more clearly than ever before, a place for education and learning, dialogue and debate (Hein 1998; Hooper-Greenhill 1994; Roberts 1997)." \autocite[p. 8]{insulander_designs_2009}


\subsubsection{Museum experience design}
Recent literature in the HCI field concerned with museums agrees that the museum world is rapidly changing from being collection-centered to being community-centered and for the public \autocite[p. 1]{vermeeren_museum_2018}. "Apart from broadening access to collections through, e.g., digitisation initiatives, new ways of involving the public more meaningfully and at various levels have emerged. Experiences inside museums have become more engaging, by extending the experience beyond the physical visit, or by involving the public in various forms of crowd-sourced stewardship of collections." \autocite[p. 1]{vermeeren_museum_2018}. The book \emph{Museum Experience Design: Crowds, Ecosystems and Novel technologies} \autocite{vermeeren_museum_2018} presents four key themes relevant for designers concerned with experience design in museums: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Engaging the public,
    \item Cultivating diverse audiences,
    \item Availing ourselves of the benefits of digital technology,
    \item and, Leveraging museums’ roles as players in larger economic and cultural ecosystems.
\end{itemize}

 "Too often we (the museum) prioritize our mandate to hold and protect our collections and stop short of making them relevant to today’s audiences, real or potential. Too often we are zoomed way too far in on our objects, and lose sight of what people less invested might know, think, or want from us" \autocite[p. 1]{vermeeren_museum_2018}. In light of this, \autocite{vermeeren_vincent_2018} case on \emph{Becoming Vincent} is instructive where it among the findings is implied how "the importance of and attention to content is related to the increasing value associated with craftsmanship, in the belief that this will provide a real, genuine, and authentic experience" \autocite[p. 298]{vermeeren_vincent_2018}. "When we pull our focus back from the individual museum and its obsession with its objects, we find a larger community outside that is largely indifferent to our obsessions, and needs a story, even a superstar, to motivate their interest" \autocite[p. 1]{vermeeren_museum_2018}. "This is why storytelling can help turn any experience into a memorable and meaningful experience, by unlocking values that would otherwise be not so immediately recognizable by the listeners" \autocite[p. 299]{vermeeren_vincent_2018}.
 Then, "a struggle emerges between the museum’s role as protector of authentic objects and the “facts” around them and its role as a site of experiences—preferably extraordinary ones, because if not, why bother? "\autocite[p. 1]{vermeeren_museum_2018}. "So, while digital apps take us on mobile adventures and open up trails of wonder for some, the vast majority of our visitors still default to analog first and foremost. The more we can design for blended environments that mix the virtues of analog and digital affordances in mutually reinforcing ways to foster a context for meaningful engagement with museum objects, the better off we’ll be" \autocite[p. 1]{vermeeren_museum_2018}.


\section{Exhibition and dissemination practise}
In this section I will present terms and concepts to explain what I mean when I talk about exhibition and dissemination practise. This lays the foundation for the vocabulary which I have adopted throughout the literature review, and brought with me into the thesis project. 
% Comment more about how this section functions as both a literature review and as a practical vocabulary for "things to look for" .

\subsection{Museum discourse and cultural moralism} 
% and look for power structures/ imbalances (cultural moralism or imperialism) in terms of addressing sustainability in museums
In this section one of the major influences from critical humanities literature is presented, which vocabulary have helped to better “read”, describe and understand a museum, exhibition or a specific installation. Mieke Bal is a dutch cultural theorist, video artist and Professor in Literary Theory at the University of Amsterdam, with academic interest and background in humanities, media and culture studies. From her writings on cultural analysis and discourses in the museum, she proposes a humanistic perspective on what differentiates the “new” from the “old” museology, where she presents the museum as a discourse and the exhibition as an utterance within that discourse. By bringing this discursive perspective to the museum, it deprives the museal practise of its innocence, and provides it with the accountability it and its users are entitled to \autocite[p. 214]{Thi_book}. Part of her argument and critique is that politics come straight out of, or more precisely are bound up with, the museal discourse \autocite[p. 214]{Thi_book}, and proposes a threefold direction to museology researchers. First she suggest to systematically analyse the narrative-rhetorical structure of the specific museum, in order to refine the categories and deepen insight into their effects. Secondly she suggest to look at the connection between the museal discourse and the institutions foundation and history, and thirdly she see the need to do self-critical analysis of the museal discourse as a consequence of the nature of discourse. % kanskje nevne at hun særlig har studert: cultural moralism and cultural imperialism i museer som tidligere har disseminert kolonialisering som et tema for globalisering i museer.. 

With my background and scope of thesis it is both irrelevant and I am by no means capable to do a discursive analysis the way Mieke Bal proposes. I do however find aspects of Bal’s discursive perspective relevant, like her proposal of how one can do a narrative-rhetorical systematic analysis of a specific museum. She provides a set of new terms and vocabulary so that I better can “read”, describe, understand and do research on a specific museum and/ or specific installation. I find this perspective along with the extended vocabulary it provides useful so that I better can identify meaningful relations between user activity at installations/ artefacts and the museum experience.

The museum is an attractive object of study because it requires interdisciplinary analysis; it has the debate on aesthetics at its core, and it is essentially a social institution \autocite[p. 202]{Thi_book}. % Cultural moralism is a concept described as (...xxx...), fronted by Mieke bal.....::
Mieke Bal account for and describe the issue of cultural imperialism in museums, exemplifying case studies related to natural history types of museums that conserves and display ethnic objects and artefacts representing cultures and cultural properties from the past. The ethnographic museum is clearly the most obviously politically charged institution, and it poses the immediate problem of cultural property and collective ownership \autocite[p. 202]{Thi_book}. It raises the question if former colonists are entitled to hold onto objects taken by their ancestors from former colonies, or should they give these back to the country of origin the ancestors of whose inhabitants were their original owners? % Vergo also say something about this, the "problem" of museums placing objects to/ and from cultures. Often to display power. 

I think this (critical and) introspective perspective is necessary to have in a museum context or space addressing sustainability, because the intention of making a meaningful interactive experience is to strengthen the message conveyed by the museum. Both the designer and especially the museum need to be aware of and able to answer to the moral and ethical questions raised in terms of what the message they convey, actually conveys. And that the act of strengthening that message actually send people out of the museum with reflections and thoughts that hopefully leads to social action (climate action, consciousness). % Do the museum "have the balls" to stand up for and answer to the kind of actions they actually promote?

\subsection{Artefacts, artworks and installations}
The very act of collecting has a political, ideological or aesthetic dimension which cannot be overlooked, and Vergo questions; "what makes certain objects, rather than others 'worth' preserving? \autocite[p. 2]{vergo_museology_1989}. "The original intention behind the establishment of museums, was that they should remove artefacts from their current context of ownership and use, (...), and insert them into a new environment which would provide them with a different meaning" \autocite[p. 6]{vergo_museology_1989}. "The essential feature of museums - and what differentiates them from the many extensive private collections which preceded them - was, at first, that the meanings which were attributed to the artefacts were held to be arbitrary; and, second, that the collections should be accessible to at least a portion of the public, who where expected to obtain some form of educational benefit from the experience" \autocite[p. 6]{vergo_museology_1989}.

The heritage museum conserves and exhibits artefacts, while the art museum, works of art. It seems obvious what differs the artefact vs the artwork; yet they differ in regard as to what they represent. Both the artefact and the artwork is charged with cultural meaning. It tells us about a larger cultural situation, e.g. aesthetic conceptions or world views, conceptions of representations or the social relevance of art. However, these meanings is only yielded if we are able to “read” it, or is put in some context that illuminates the cultural meaning \autocite[p. 206]{Thi_book}.

The term artefact suggests a man made object charged with cultural meaning which can, if studied carefully, offer us information on the society in which it has been created \autocite[p. 205]{Thi_book}. The difference between the artefact according to the above definition and the common idea of art is that the former takes for granted what the other represses: the possibility of cultural difference. Instead, artworks are viewed as standing for an aesthetic, and is therefore considered metaphors, transferring their specific aesthetic to the one current sufficient to make the work “readable” as art, regardless of what it could tell us about the culture it comes from \autocite[p. 206]{Thi_book}. While the ethnic artefact, in contrast, is first and foremost considered to be a representative of the larger context of the culture it comes from \autocite[p. 206]{Thi_book}. Hence, it is not a metaphor but synecdoche. Synecdoche is the figure of rhetoric where an element, a small part, stands for the whole simply by virtue of its being a part of that whole \autocite[p. 206]{Thi_book}. Thus the artefact is only readable as culture, no matter what aesthetic qualities it may also have.


\subsection{The curatorial function}
% Kanskje introdusere med noe sånn: Fra boken (thinking about exhibitions), kapittel 1 skriver (Carmen?) om kuratorens rolle i museet. 
The curator are, above all, the institutionally recognised experts of the art-world establishment, whether they operate inside an institution or independently. More than art critics or gallery dealers, they establish the meaning and status of contemporary art through its acquisition, exhibition, and interpretation \autocite[p. 22]{Thi_book}. To a greater extent than other art-world professionals, curators additionally depend on an established infrastructure to support their efforts. This infrastructure includes institutionalised networks, such as those provided by museums, galleries, or alternative spaces; financial sponsors, whether public, private or corporate, and teams of technical or professional experts \autocite[p. 22]{Thi_book}. Curators are the sanctioned intermediaries of these institutional and professional networks on the one hand, and; artists and audiences on the other. The curatorial function is, this, inherently restricted by the interests of the larger or more powerful groups and constituencies in the museum \autocite[p. 22]{Thi_book}.

By selecting, framing and interpreting peripheral art in exhibitions and exhibition catalogues, for instance, art curators can claim to be shaping a more democratic space where specific cultural groups can recognise themselves \autocite[p. 23]{Thi_book}. As the debates of recent years have shown, “identity” is not an “essence” that can be translated into a particular set of conceptual or visual traits. It is, rather a negotiated construct that results from the multiple positions of the subject vis-a-vis the social, cultural and political conditions which contains it. How then, can exhibitions or collections attempt to represent the social, cultural and political complexities of groups without reducing their subjects to essentialist stereotypes? \autocite[p. 23]{Thi_book}.

This situation places the cultural broker at the very core of a contradiction: on one hand, she can be credited for helping to tear down artworld hierarchies, seemingly democratizing the space for cultural action; on the other hand, in a market scenario where “identity” can only be a reductive construct, the framing and packaging of images of the collective self can only result in a highly delusionary enterprise \autocite[p. 23-24]{Thi_book}. The tensions of this contradiction confront art curators with a dilemma; where should they position themselves vis-a-vis the identities of the groups they claim to respect? \autocite[p. 24]{Thi_book}.

\subsection{Dialogical engagement}
"Museums started off as institutions focusing on collecting and preserving objects, open for the public to come and watch. The primary purpose for visitors to come to the museum was to see the original objects. A first notable shift saw the museums move from a collection focus to a visitor focus and from a mission for objects preservation and access provision to a mission of offering meaningful engagements with the collection and rewarding learning experiences for their public. The concept of ‘museum experience’ is the pinnacle of this historical shift, as it implies a focus on the visitor and connections between visitor and objects rather than a focus on collections. In the course of time, new types of museum experiences gradually emerged. The degree of sophistication and immersion increased exponentially when experiences started to be enhanced by the integration of interactive and digital media. In many science and technology museums, for example, visitor engagement and participation are uplifted through the use of new media (e.g. video games, interactive installations and other forms of edutainment) to encourage visitors to engage with the content on exhibit, to experiment with the techniques on show and to appropriate the visiting experience by making it meaningful and memorable. This trend is being adopted also by art museums, where it is by definition more difficult to let visitors experiment with the collections." \autocite[p. 3]{vermeeren_museum_2018}.

\subsection{Museology and the Anthropocene}
In a call for publication and participation to the conference "The future of tradition in museology" organized by ICOFOM in Kyoto 2019, the same institutional change and questions concerning the future of museology that we just have read through the eyes of \autocite{ross_interpreting_2015}, \autocite{vergo_museology_1989} and \autocite{vermeeren_museum_2018}, is addressed. They present five directions to be considered worthy of further research, whereas two of them stand out in term of this thesis's research interest. \autocite[p. 4]{icofom_kyoto_2019}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Museological tradition vs global development and new technologies:} What role does museology play and what position does it take in relation to the rapid changes that are taking place? (...), e.g. will cyberspace out rule other spaces and materialities – (...), considering the return to extreme political positions and the “war” of information and knowledge?
    \item \textbf{Museology and the Anthropocene:} How can museology reduce the disastrous effect man has on our planet earth and our living conditions? How can museology help to bridge the gap between mind and matter – the gap that is the reason for the state of mankind right now – the belief that man is superior to nature and all other creatures? (...) So what impact should this insight bring to our dealing with museums, objects and collections, with a sustainable future in mind?
\end{itemize}

\section{Museums communicating the science of climate change}

"Social research underlines how the mass media frames and presents environmental change and risk in ways that become contested cultural constructs embedded in deep ideological structures" \autocite[p. 1]{salazar_mediations_2011}." While significant attention has concentrated on the mass media, less consideration has been given to examining the role of museums and science centres in communicating the science of climate change" \autocite[p. 1]{salazar_mediations_2011}. In the article "The mediations of climate change: museums as citizens media" \autocite{salazar_mediations_2011} looks at museums as cultural brokers around the public understandings of climate change. By engaging with recent conceptualisations around citizens and public media practises, Salazar proposes mechanisms through which the museum sector can act as change-agents in fostering a new form of public pedagogy that incorporates differing civic epistemologies around climate change education and action" \autocite[p. 1]{salazar_mediations_2011}.

% https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOhfxHHhqpg: Art installation for World Oceans Day at the California Academy of Sciences by futurists Wallace J. Their installation \emph{Plastic Century} is an interactive installation created for the California Academy of Sciences that explores the relationship between plastic, people, and the environment over the 100 years since the birth of Jacques Cousteau.

In a commentary by Richard J. Hebda, they look into the Royal British Columbia Museum (RBCM)’s voyage into the issue of climate change as an example of how museums can play a central role in addressing contemporary issues. Traditionally, museums have been a window to the past, "a place where the past lives" \autocite[p. 1]{hebda_article}. A lot of the issues and societal attitudes that are addressed in the commentary are still relevant today. Traditionally, human history and natural history has been seen as two solitudes that have been exhibited separately. A key appeal for the RBCM, a typical natural history museum to do a climate change exhibit, was to pursue the opportunity to link and integrate the two solitudes in a compelling and relevant manner \autocite[p. 2]{hebda_article}. They justify that the combining of the two is necessary because the exact same challenge is also central in the sustainability debate, at the core of the problem facing society today \autocite[p.2]{hebda_article}. In 2007 when the RBCM decided to make the climate change exhibition, the question of climate change was still a controversial issue \autocite[p.2]{hebda_article}. Addressing the increasing evidence and knowledge in terms of climate change and how it affects and is affected by humans, nearly all reputable scientists felt that change was under way and action was needed \autocite[p.2]{hebda_article}. The political and public atmosphere was foggy, as people did not know whom to believe, what information was science-based rather than rhetoric, and where real uncertainty lay \autocite[p.2]{hebda_article}. The RBCM saw a clear opportunity to dispel the fog and to enlighten their audiences \autocite[p.2]{hebda_article}.

\subsubsection{Changing Climate, Changing Attitude?}

"Many science museums and science centers now recognize their potential to arouse young peoples’ interest and awareness, and are starting to engage them in the climate change debate (e.g. Science Museum London, Australian Museum, Aquarium San Diego, American Museum of Natural History)" \autocite[p. 95]{gorr_changing_2014}. "Whereas some studies show evidence that museum and science center experiences may result in attitude change (Smithsonian Institution 2011; Spock 2000), there is evidence from a range of environmental-related exhibitions that initial changes in attitude and understanding fade after a couple of weeks because museum visitors tend to seek confirmation of their pre-existing attitudes and cling to erroneous beliefs (Adelman, Falk, and James 2000; Cakir 2008; Dierking et al. 2004)" \autocite[p. 95]{gorr_changing_2014}. "Some examples have even illustrated that attempts to increase people’s understanding of climate change enhanced skepticism and resulted in visitors’ total rejection of the issue (Jones 2009; Webster 2010)" \autocite[p. 96]{gorr_changing_2014}.

"Aiming to examine attitude changes in young people, the described study drew on general findings about attitude from social sciences and psychology. A closer look at the theory reveals that attitude is a highly complex and ambivalent term; for instance, a person may want to express both positive and negative attitudes toward the same object (Wood 2000). Whether an experience leads to longer lasting attitude change depends on numerous aspects such as motivation and attention (Petty and Cacioppo 1986). Motivation is mostly dependent on clarity and on the personal relevance of a message (Petty and Cacioppo 1979; Salazar 2011), or it may result from emotions, such as empathy and enjoyment (Roberts 1993)." \autocite[p. 96]{gorr_changing_2014}.



\section{Design as Meaning Making}

\autocite{kazmierczak_meaningmaking_2003} approaches design as an interface for meaning making, or simply the design of meaning. She see "meaning" as standing for a thought induced in the receiver, originated by contact with a design. According to her, design can be simple or complex in their material and conceptual structure but, as wholes, they are interfaces for meaning making \autocite[p. 47]{kazmierczak_meaningmaking_2003}. Borrowing from literature on cognitive semiotics, she proposes a model for design which relates physical form to cognition and comprehension rather than appearance and aesthetic. According to \autocite{kazmierczak_meaningmaking_2003}, there are two reasons why cognitive semiotics offers potentially good results; "First, it is focused on bridging the gap between form and meaning making or comprehension. Thus, its method of inquiry makes it well equipped for a discussion of symbolic-cognitive human phenomena such as communication. Second, it is compatible with the concerns of design regarding the construction of communications" \autocite[p. 47]{kazmierczak_meaningmaking_2003}.

Textual and written components are essential in any museum; 

I would argue that bringing cognitive semiotics (relating to signs and symbols) can be a useful perspective when working in/ designing for museums. It enables the designer to see the museum agenda and curatorial function up against the designed object, and when working with interactivity to emphasise dialogic qualities it should be useful to have the means to see, discuss and question the semiotic aspects of the designed object..... Museums that not only are
