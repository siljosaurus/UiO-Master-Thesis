This thesis has considered the development and shift in museology practise while making clear a stronger connection between the Interaction Design / HCI field and museology. This has been explored through sustainability as a representative discourse being disseminated in museums, as a catalysator and manifestation of how museums aim to better disseminate (show and tell) contemporary discourses in society. 

The aim has been to theorize a new way to look at meaningfulness as a quality that you can design for, as a way to answer how one can design meaningful interactive experiences in a museum space that addresses sustainability.
